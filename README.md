Martian (Alien) Translator

Pitch:
In the olden days, our biggest communication barriers were within humanity and its many languages. However, times have changed, as the Martians and Earthlings have made contact with one another through advanced but private government technology, beginning to integrate our populations and cultures. But what does this mean for the commonfolk of both the Martians and Earthlings? How will WE understand each other through this language barrier that had once been separated by many light years? How will a human being make amends or deescalate misunderstandings with their Martian neighbor? Do you want to keep yourself safe and socialized in regard to your Martian peers?
Hello, we are Martian Incorporated, and we are here to help you with our new Martian translator app. Utilizing newly decoded Martian literature and working with official Martian government translators, we have discovered ways to translate human language into something Martian-optimized. As we are a new technology situated in the United States, we are sad to say that we only support English to Martian translation as of current, but this is subject to change in the near future as we improve our technology.
Martian readers can decode our letters, but they still struggle to comprehend human language structure. Thatâ€™s where we come in! For only $4.99 USD per month, you can have a convenient pocket translator for your extraterrestrial needs. Just write into the application and show your device to the Martian you are trying to communicate with and their personal Martian devices can instantly interpret the Latin letters displayed on your screen. In addition, for the Martians, we offer multiple response prompts that can be used for a variety of situations, allowing them to respond to humans after the translator app has spoken.
We offer a free first month to make sure that the customer is satisfied and have excellent customer service representatives. If you have any extra queries, contact us on our website. So what are you waiting for? Sign up for our Martian translator app today!
